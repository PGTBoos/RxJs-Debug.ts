# Angular RxJs-Debug.ts
RxJs console debug (simple)

I've created this script as a simple tool that can be used in place of tap and console.log commands
With the bennefit that this command only works in developer mode.

Within the code the log levels can be altered, and it can be disabled.
As you wont need this often, but rather in case of problems.
And you would not want to log all that info in a production environment.
Henche this code was created.
